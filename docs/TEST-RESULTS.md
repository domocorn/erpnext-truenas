# Test record

Deployed initial ERPNext Setup -> Created fake company and added some fake data:
	Database stayed intact through container restarts, server restarts, and opening and saving the YAML with no changes made

## Author-side validation

Python compilation, generated YAML round-trip, and local unit tests are run when
packaging this starter. Five unit tests passed, including interrupted-install and
unmanaged-site refusal, password interpolation, and existing-site preservation.
All Python source parsed successfully. These do not establish real Docker/TrueNAS
compatibility; Docker is unavailable in the authoring environment.
